## Future analyses
From future analysis, investors may want to further stratify trips by weekdays stratified by user type (general customer vs. subscriber). Additonally, if possible with more expansive data, investors may want to know of those who are using Citibike services in NYC, how many are locals versus visitors. It may be wise to comapre August data to data from other months (April-June) to see if these trends continue.
